
ADDING TRANSLATIONS FOR A NEW LANGUAGE

1) Copy the .pot file to the right location (see existing translation) and change the extension to .po
   (.pot stands for .po-template)

2) Edit it with an editor for .po files (e.g. "poedit")
   When saving, it will generate a .mo file. This is the machinereadable file, which the game will use.


MAINTAINING TRANSLATIONS (after string changes)

When strings in the addon change, then the translations must be touched, too.

1) You must generate a new .pot file
The following command would do that on unix systems. On Windows, it may be enought to replace / with \.
The commands assume that you execute them in the base directory of this addon.

wmlxgettext is a perl script which lies in you wesnoth_install_directory/utils/wmlxgettext
Either you add that directory to you PATH variable (google for that ;) ), or you type the whole path for it in the next command.
wmlxgettext is using a programm called gettext - you need to have it available, too. Maybe you already have.

wmlxgettext _main.cfg scenarios/*.cfg utils/*.cfg --directory=. --domain=wesnoth-Kromire > translations/wesnoth-Kromire.pot

2) So you have now a new translation template file, but the translations are still in the old files?
   Let's merge them! (maybe make a backup first)

msgmerge -U translations/de/LC_MESSAGES/wesnoth-Kromire.po translations/wesnoth-EoM_Kromire.pot
   (-U = update, the second file remains untouched, the first file get's updated)

3) Now, proceed like when translating. Have a look at the .po file.
   If a string did change, it's usually detected, and the translation of the former string is suggested.
   You have to check the marked translations and to unmark them.
   As usual, when saving with you po-editor, the machinereadable .mo file is created.

   If the string changes in the addon or was just a spelling mistake in the english string,
   then you can repair the translations of languages which you don't even know.
